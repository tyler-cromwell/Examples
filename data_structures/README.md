# Data Structures
Examples of basic data structures:

- [Deque][deque]
- [Linked List][list]
- [Queue][queue]
- [Stack][stack]

Additionally each of these files, particularly `List.py`, serve as examples of Python's "Dunder" methods which are special methods that implement functionality of things such as brackets on lists ([]) or the `len()` function and more.
